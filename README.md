# AirTable Based Link Shortener

This is an archived repository. For an actively maintained copy of this repository, please visit [@hackclub/hack.af](https://github.com/hackclub/hack.af). It uses a similar codebase, but it has been rewritten by @zanedb to run serverlessly on Vercel. 

## Setup

* Please make a copy of the template AirTable Base: [https://go.mingjie.info/template](https://go.mingjie.info/template)
* Please also grab the AirTable API Key & Base Key from the API documentations. Head [here](https://airtable.com/api) and click on the base you just created to get started.
* Set `AIRTABLE_BASE` to your Base Key, and `AIRTABLE_KEY` to your API Key.
* Set `APP_USER` to your desired username.
* Set `APP_SECRET` to a passphrase or key that only you know.
* Set `LOGGING` to `on` if you want to enable logging, `off` if otherwise.
* Set `ROOT_REDIRECT` to the URL you want people to be redirected to when they visit the landing page.

## Using

All links will be routed through a 302 (Temporary Redirect) because you're using AirTable. Simply visit `example.com/slug` to get redirected.

Navigate to `/admin` for a GUI to add new links.

## Using the API

You can make changes the database easily with the API.

### `/api/trace`
Find where a slug points to without getting redirected.

#### Parameters
* `slug` (required) - the slug you're looking up.

#### Result
* `dest` - the destination URL.
* `error` - the error message, if exists.
* `status` - status code of the request

### `/api/push`
Make changes to a specific record.

#### Parameters
* `auth` (required) - the `APP_SECRET` environment variable, used for authentication.
* `dest` (optional) - the destination URL you're pointing to. Must exist if `slug` does not exist.
* `slug` (optional) - the slug you're making changes to. If it does not exist, a random slug will be generated. Must exist if `dest` does not exist.
